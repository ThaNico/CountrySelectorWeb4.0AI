# CountrySelectorWeb4.0AI
This is the latest generation of country selectors (and a bad ui joke)  
It takes approximately 5mn03 to loop through the countries, I might improve this in the future, eventually, after some sleep  

Thanks to https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons for the flags and (reworked) json :)
